# Machine-Learning-classification-methods
Here you can see different scripts for the following classification methods depended on the train dataset you want to test:
->k-NN Nearest Neighbors classifier (mobPriceKNN or airlines_DelayKNN) 
->NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier (mobPriceBayes or airlines_DelayBayes)
->Neural Networks (mobPriceNeural or airlines_DelayNeural)
->Support Vector Machines (SVM) (mobPriceSVM or airlines_DelaySVM)

In order to run one of the classification methods scripts, you need to have the corresponding
train dataset csv file in the same directory as the script you are trying to run.
